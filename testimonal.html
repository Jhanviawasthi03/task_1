                            <p>In the past, I’ve been to gyms and achieved what I have wanted but then get fed up with it and never seem to find the time. I saw the clip on facebook and thought that’s what I need – someone to push me and keep me going and to make sure the exercises I do are correct.
Once I had tried the class all I wanted to do was get started! I love these classes, I know I moan a lot (sorry Becky) but at the end of it I really feel like I’ve done a good workout.The sessions are 30 minutes intensive but you get through </p>

                            <p>“I spend my time working long hours behind my desk and looking after two children and have paid little attention to my body and was feeling sluggish.
                                I participated in last year’s world record bounce and decided to take a taster session. I have since worked out with onesixeight for about 15 weeks now. The sessions are 30 minutes intensive but you get through the time so quickly due to the friendliness and motivation from the personal trainers.</p>
